## Project Titlte : Oil Spill Detection From Satellite Imagery.

## ‚úàÔ∏èProblem Statement

To develop OIL Spill Detection from Satellite Images in order to build spilling detection system for related government agency i.e. Department of Coastal Resource, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

**1. Reactive Detection**

To identify oil spilled properties i.e. Location, Size of Spilled Boundary etc. to launch the oil spill response plan according to IMO/UNEP Standard and Guidelines.
    
    
    
**2. Proactive Detection**

To establish the schedule-based ocean monitoring to ensure the compliance of oil spill prevention of related operator. 
    
## üöÄ Background

An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil. (Wikipedia)
    
    
### The consequence of Oil Spill
 




**1. Environmental Impacts**

Major oil spills are bad for the environment because they damage wildlife, marine ecosystems, and coastal environments. spilled oil can affect animals and plants in two ways: dir–µ—Åt from the oil and from the response or cleanup process. oil spills can also harm air quality. The chemicals in crude oil are mostly hydrocarbons that contains toxic chemicals such as benzenes, toluene, poly-aromatic hydrocarbon and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These chemicals can introduce adverse health effects when being inhaled into human body. (Wikipedia)
    
**2. Economical Impacts**

Oil spills can lead to severe disruption for the tourist industry. Contamination of coastal areas with high amenity value is a common feature of many oil spills. In addition to costs incurred by clean-up activities, serious economic losses can be experienced by industries and individuals dependent on coastal resources.(ITOPF)


**3. Human Impacts**

An oil spill represents an immediate negative effects on human health, including respiratory and reproductive problems as well as liver, and immune system damage. Oil spills causing future oil supply to decline also effects the everyday life of humans such as the potential closure of beaches, parks, fisheries and fire hazards. (Wikipedia)
    
    
### The cause of Oil Spill

Oil Spill can caused from main source with the following items, 

1. Oil Tanker/Transport Vessels

2. Oil Rig/Platform

3. Pipeline

4. Storage Tank
